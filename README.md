## Overview of the analysis:
Ridesharing data was explored to assess rideshare activity and to improve access of ride-sharing services by analyzing affordability and availability in underserved neighborhoods. Python tools such as Matplotlib were used to creat great visualizations based on city type (rural, urban, and suburban), average fare, and number of drivers in each city type.
