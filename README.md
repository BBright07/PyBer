## Overview of the analysis:
Ridesharing data was explored to assess rideshare activity and to improve access of ride-sharing services by analyzing affordability and availability in underserved neighborhoods. Python tools such as Matplotlib were used to creat great visualizations based on city type (rural, urban, and suburban), average fare, and number of drivers in each city type. 

## Results:
The total rides: 2,375, total drivers: 68,709 , total fares: 63,538.64.

Note: Circle size correlates with driver count per city
The results show that urban areas are overwhelmingly served while the rural areas were disproportionately served by drivers with high numbers of rides per city especially in the urban areas.

### Fig 2
The number of overall rides were in line with the driver access, with Urban at the top followed by suburban, and rural. Rural: 125, Suburban: 625, Urban: 1625

### Fig 3 
The results show that rural areas have the highest fare compared to urban and suburban areas. Average fares -- Rural : 34.623440, Suburban:30.970128, Urban: 24.525772

### Fig 4
The driver count data also shows a disproportionately low rate for rural areas with a significant high for urban areas. Rural :78,Suburban: 490, Urban: 2405

## Summary:
Overall, the sum of fares was higher in the urban areas due to the high volume of rides in those areas compared to rural or suburban regions. However, the per ride fare in rural areas was overwhelmingly high in comparison. Additionally, the availability of drivers in rural areas was also comparably lower that the two other areas. As a result, rural areas are the most underserved and most expensive on a case by case basis, while urban areas have the least expenisve ride cost and most bountiful driver pool. To address disparities:
1.Increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban areas
2.Decrease the ride cost per rural and suburban rider
3.Advertise the changes in underserved areas to encourage ridesharing
